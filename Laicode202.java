hard
Given two sorted arrays of integers, find the Kth smallest number.

Assumptions

The two given arrays are not null and at least one of them is not empty

K >= 1, K <= total lengths of the two sorted arrays

Examples

A = {1, 4, 6}, B = {2, 3}, the 3rd smallest number is 3.

A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {}, the 2nd smallest number is 2.
