//Laicode 288. First Non-Repeating Character In Stream
//https://app.laicode.io/app/problem/288
// Given a stream of characters, find the first non-repeating character from stream. You need to tell the first non-repeating character in O(1) time at any moment.

// Implement two methods of the class:

// read() - read one character from the stream
// firstNonRepeating() - return the first non-repoeating character from the stream at any time when calling the method, return null if there does not exist such characters
// Examples:
// read:
// a   b   c   a   c   c    b
// firstNonRepeating:
// a   a   a   b   b   b   null

public class FirstNon-RepeatingCharacter {
